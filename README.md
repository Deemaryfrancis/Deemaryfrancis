# Mary_Francis


Hello Tech world 👋 I am Mary Donatus Francis
Passionate about ensuring digital excellence, I am a seasoned Software QA professional specializing in web, mobile, and API testing. With a keen eye for detail, I meticulously review UI designs and execute comprehensive regression, sanity, and smoke tests to guarantee seamless user experiences.

My technical toolkit includes proficiency in Python, JavaScript, and SQL, and I am adept at utilizing tools such as mySQL, Cypress, Postman, Swagger, GitHub, Jenkins, and GitHub Pages. Always hungry for knowledge, I am currently immersed in learning JAVA and Selenium to expand my skill set and contribute even more effectively to the testing landscape.

Beyond functional testing, I bring a performance-oriented approach, capable of conducting load tests using JMeter. My commitment to quality extends beyond just identifying bugs; I am dedicated to ensuring that every digital product I touch meets and exceeds user expectations.

🌱 I’m always learning something new
👯 I’m open to collaborating on any software testing product
